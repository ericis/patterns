## Types of Patterns

### Architecture Pattern

An architecture pattern expresses a fundamental structural organization or schema
for complex systems. It provides a set of predefined subsystems, specifies their
unique responsibilities, and includes the decision-enabling rules and guidelines
for organizing the relationships between them. The architecture pattern for a
software system illustrates the macro-level structure for the whole software
solution. An architectural pattern is a set of principles and a coarse-grained
pattern that provides an abstract framework for a family of systems. An
architectural pattern improves partitioning and promotes design reuse by
providing solutions to frequently recurring problems. Precisely speaking, an
architectural pattern comprises a set of principles that shape an application.

### Design Pattern

A design pattern provides a scheme for refining the subsystems or components of
a system, or the relationships between them. It describes a commonly recurring
structure of communicating components that solves a general design problem within
a particular context. The design pattern for a software system prescribes the
ways and means of building the software components. The design pattern
articulates how the various components within the system collaborate with one
another in order to fulfill the desired functionality.
